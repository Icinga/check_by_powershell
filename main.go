Icinga check plugin to run checks and other commands directly on
any Windows system using WinRM (Windows Remote Management) and Powershell

Main use case would be to call one of the plugins from the Icinga Powershell Framework.
This will avoid the requirement of installing an Icinga 2 agent on every Windows system.

The plugin will require WinRM to be preconfigured for access with a HTTPs or HTTP connection.
